# Exercise 1: What Are You Learning?

# Step 1: Define a Function
# Define a function named display_message().
# This function should not take any parameters.

# Step 2: Print a Message
# For example: “I am learning about functions in Python.”

# Step 3: Call the Function
# This will execute the code inside the function and print your message.

def display_message():
    # this function displays a message
    print("I am learning about functions in Python.")

display_message()


# Exercise 2: What’s Your Favorite Book?

# Step 1: Define a Function with a Parameter
# Define a function named favorite_book().
# This function should accept one parameter called title.

# Step 2: Print a Message with the Title
# The function needs to output a message like “One of my favorite books is <title>”.

# Step 3: Call the Function with an Argument
# Call the favorite_book() function and provide a book title as an argument.
# For example: favorite_book("Alice in Wonderland").

def favorite_book(title):
    print(f"{title} is one of my favorite books.")

favorite_book("Ender's Game")


# Exercise 3: Some Geography

# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters ok
# Define a function named describe_city().
# This function should accept two parameters: city and country.
# Give the country parameter a default value, such as “Unknown”.

# Step 2: Print a Message
# Inside the function, set up the code to display a sentence like “ is in “.
# Replace <city> and <country> with the parameter values.

# Step 3: Call the Function
# Call the describe_city() function with different city and country combinations.
# Try calling it with and without providing the country argument to see the default value in action.
# Example: describe_city("Reykjavik", "Iceland") and describe_city("Paris").

def describe_city(city, country="Unknown"):
    print(f"{city} is in {country}.")

describe_city("New York", "USA")
describe_city("Paris", "France")
describe_city("Addis Ababa")

# Exercise 4: Random

# Step 1: Import the random Module
# At the beginning of your script, use import random to access the random number generation functions.

# Step 2: Define a Function with a Parameter
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 as a parameter.

# Step 3: Generate a Random Number
# Inside the function, use random.randint(1, 100) to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.

# Step 4: Compare the Numbers
# If they are the same, print a success message. Otherwise, print a fail message and display both numbers.

# Step 5: Call the Function
# Call the function with a number between 1 and 100.

import random
def user_num(one_to_100):
    random_num = random.randint(1, 100)
    if one_to_100 == random_num:
        print("Success!")
    else:
        print(f"Fail! Your number is {one_to_100} but the random number is {random_num}")

user_num(12)


#  Exercise 5: Let’s Create Some Personalized Shirts!

# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters
# Define a function called make_shirt().
# This function should accept two parameters: size and text.

# Step 2: Print a Summary Message
# Set up the function to display a sentence summarizing the shirt’s size and message.

# Step 3: Call the Function

# Step 4: Modify the Function with Default Values
# Modify the make_shirt() function so that size has a default value of “large” and text has a default value of “I love Python”.

# Step 5: Call the Function with Default and Custom Values
# Call make_shirt() to make a large shirt with the default message.
# Call make_shirt() to make a medium shirt with the default message.
# Call make_shirt() to make a shirt of any size with a different message.

# Step 6 (Bonus): Keyword Arguments
# Call make_shirt() using keyword arguments (e.g., make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")).

# def make_shirt(size, text):
#     print(f"Your shirt size is {size} and says {text}.")

# make_shirt("Large", "I love Python")

def make_shirt(size ="large", text = "I Love Python"):
    print(f"Your shirt size is {size} and says {text}.")

make_shirt("large")
make_shirt("medium")
make_shirt("XL", "Firefly Rules!")

make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")

# Exercise 6: Magicians…

# Step 1: Create a List of Magician Names
# Create a list called magician_names with the given names:
# ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# Step 2: Create a Function to Display Magicians
# Create a function called show_magicians() that takes the magician_names list as a parameter.
# Inside the function, iterate through the list and print each magician’s name.

# Step 3: Create a Function to Modify the List
# Create a function called make_great() that takes the magician_names list as a parameter.
# Inside the function, use a for loop to iterate through the list and add “the Great” before each magician’s name.

# Step 4: Call the Functions
# Call make_great() to modify the list.
# Call show_magicians() to display the modified list.

magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

def show_magicians(magician_names):
    for name in magician_names:
        print(name)

show_magicians(magician_names)

# def make_great(magician_names):
#     for name in magician_names:
#         # map(list(f"The Great {name}"))
make_great = list(map(lambda name: f"The Great {name}", magician_names))

# make_great(magician_names)
show_magicians(make_great)


#  Exercise 7: Temperature Advice

# Step 1: Create the get_random_temp() Function
# Create a function called get_random_temp() that returns a random integer between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius.

# Step 2: Create the main() Function
# Create a function called main(). Inside this function:
# Call get_random_temp() to get a random temperature.
# Store the temperature in a variable and print a friendly message like:
# “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”

# Step 3: Provide Temperature-Based Advice
# Inside main(), provide advice based on the temperature:
# Below 0°C: e.g., “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today.”
# Between 0°C and 16°C: e.g., “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat.”
# Between 16°C and 23°C: e.g., “Nice weather.”
# Between 24°C and 32°C: e.g., “A bit warm, stay hydrated.”
# Between 32°C and 40°C: e.g., “It’s really hot! Stay cool.”

# Step 4: Floating-Point Temperatures (Bonus)
# Modify get_random_temp() to return a random floating-point number using random.uniform() for more accurate temperature values.

# Step 5: Month-Based Seasons (Bonus)
# Instead of directly generating a random temperature, ask the user for a month (1-12) and determine the season using if/elif conditions.
# Modify get_random_temp() to return temperatures specific to each season.

import random
# def get_random_temp():
#     temp_now = random.randint(-10, 40)
#     print(f"The temperature right now is {temp_now} degrees Celsius.")

# get_random_temp()

def main():
    temp_now = random.randint(-10, 40)
    print(f"The temperature right now is {temp_now} degrees Celsius.")
    if temp_now < 0:
        print("Brrr, that\’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today.")
    elif temp_now < 16:
        print("Quite chilly! Don\’t forget your coat.")
    elif temp_now < 23:
        print("Nice weather.")
    elif temp_now < 32:
        print("A bit warm, stay hydrated.")
    elif temp_now <= 40:
        print("It\’s really hot! Stay cool.")
              
main()
