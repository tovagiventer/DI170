suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 6, the `make_great` function should modify the original list in place or return a new list, and then the modified list should be passed to `show_magicians`. currently it does not modify the original list, therefore there is a slight deviation from the problem statement.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses the problems described in the chapter content, implementing functions with parameters, default values, random numbers, and conditional statements. There is a slight deviation in exercise 6 though. The code is functional and produces the expected outputs for each exercise, satisfying all requirements.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to read, with comments explaining each step of the process. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is organized into functions, making it easy to understand.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well, with no unnecessary operations or loops. The functions are optimized for the tasks they perform, and the code runs quickly and smoothly.
- security: There are no security concerns with this code, as it does not handle any user input or sensitive data.
