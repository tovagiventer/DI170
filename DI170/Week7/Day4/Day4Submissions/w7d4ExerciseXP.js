//  Exercise 1 : List of people
// Instructions
const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];


// Part I - Review about arrays
// Write code to remove “Greg” from the people array.

people.shift()
console.log(people)

// Write code to replace “James” to “Jason”.

people.splice(2, 1, "Jason")
console.log(people)

// Write code to add your name to the end of the people array.

people.push("Tova")
console.log(people)

// Write code that console.logs Mary’s index. take a look at the indexOf method on Google.

let text = [
    "Mary",
    "Devon",
    "Jason",
    "Tova"
]
let indexMary = text.indexOf("Mary")
console.log(indexMary)

// Write code to make a copy of the people array using the slice method.
// The copy should NOT include “Mary” or your name.
// Hint: remember that now the people array should look like this const people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"];
// Hint: Check out the documentation for the slice method

let boyPeople = people.slice(1, 3)
console.log(boyPeople)

// Write code that gives the index of “Foo”. Why does it return -1 ?

let indexFoo = text.indexOf("Foo")
console.log(indexFoo) //passing a parameter that doesn't exist will return a negative one.

// Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
// Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array?

let last = people[people.length -1] //the index of the last element should be 1 lower than the length of the array, since index starts at 0 and length starts at 1.
console.log(last)

// Part II - Loops
// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and console.log each person.

for (let i=0; i<people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i])
}

// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log “Devon” .
// Hint: take a look at the break statement in the lesson.

for (let i=0; i<people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i])
    if (people[i] === "Devon") {
        break;
        }
}


// 🌟 Exercise 2 : Your favorite colors
// Instructions
// Create an array called colors where the value is a list of your five favorite colors.

const colors = ["orange", "blue", "purple", "green", "pink"]
// Loop through the array and as you loop console.log a string like so: “My #1 choice is blue”, “My #2 choice is red” etc… .

for (let i=0; i<colors.length; i++) {
    console.log(`My #${i+1} choice is ${colors[i]}.`)
}
// Bonus: Change it to console.log “My 1st choice”, “My 2nd choice”, “My 3rd choice”, picking the correct suffix for each number.
// Hint : create an array of suffixes to do the Bonus

let suffix = ["st", "nd", "rd", "th", "th"]
for (let i=0; i<colors.length; i++) {
    console.log(`My ${i+1}${suffix[i]} choice is ${colors[i]}.`)
}


// Exercise 3 : Repeat the question
// Instructions
// Prompt the user for a number.
// Hint : Check the data type you receive from the prompt (ie. Use the typeof method)

// While the number is smaller than 10 continue asking the user for a new number.
// Tip : Which while loop is more relevant for this situation?

let userNum = parseInt(prompt("Pick a number. "));
console.log(typeof(userNum))
while (userNum < 10) {
    userNum = parseInt(prompt("Pick a different number. "))
}


// Exercise 4 : Building Management
// Instructions:
const building = {
    numberOfFloors: 4,
    numberOfAptByFloor: {
        firstFloor: 3,
        secondFloor: 4,
        thirdFloor: 9,
        fourthFloor: 2,
    },
    nameOfTenants: ["Sarah", "Dan", "David"],
    numberOfRoomsAndRent:  {
        sarah: [3, 990],
        dan:  [4, 1000],
        david: [1, 500],
    },
}


// Review about objects
// Copy and paste the above object to your Javascript file.

// Console.log the number of floors in the building.

console.log(building.numberOfFloors)

// Console.log how many apartments are on the floors 1 and 3.

console.log(building.numberOfAptByFloor.firstFloor), console.log(building.numberOfAptByFloor.thirdFloor)

// Console.log the name of the second tenant and the number of rooms he has in his apartment.

console.log(building.nameOfTenants[1])
console.log(building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[0])

// Check if the sum of Sarah’s and David’s rent is bigger than Dan’s rent. If it is, than increase Dan’s rent to 1200.

let totalRent = (building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.sarah[1] + building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.david[1])
    if (totalRent > building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1]) {
        building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1] = 1200
    }


// Exercise 5 : Family
// Instructions
// Create an object called family with a few key value pairs.
// Using a for in loop, console.log the keys of the object.
// Using a for in loop, console.log the values of the object.

let family = {
    father: "Andrew",
    mother: "Myrtle",
    brother: "Jimmy",
    sister: "Serena",
    petDog: "Roscoe",
    petCat: "Sphinx"
}

for (let member in family) {
    console.log(member)
}
for (let member in family) {
    console.log(family[member])
}


// Exercise 6 : Rudolf
// Instructions
const details = {
  my: 'name',
  is: 'Rudolf',
  the: 'reindeer'
}
// Given the object above and using a for loop, console.log “my name is Rudolf the reindeer”

let redNose = ""
for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(details)) {
    let currentDetail = key + " " + value + " "
    redNose += currentDetail
}
console.log(redNose)


// Exercise 7 : Secret Group
// Instructions
const names = ["Jack", "Philip", "Sarah", "Amanda", "Bernard", "Kyle"];
// A group of friends have decided to start a secret society. The society’s name will be the first letter of each of their names sorted in alphabetical order.
// Hint: a string is an array of letters
// Console.log the name of their secret society. The output should be “ABJKPS”

names.sort()
let secretSoc = ""
for (let name of names) {
    let firstInitial = name[0]
    secretSoc += firstInitial
}
console.log(secretSoc)
