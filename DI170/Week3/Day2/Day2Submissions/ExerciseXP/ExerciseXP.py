# Exercise 1: Pets

# Instructions:
# Use the provided Pets and Cat classes to create a Siamese breed, instantiate cat objects, and use the Pets class to manage them.
# See the example below, before diving in.

# Step 1: Create the Siamese Class
# Create a class called Siamese that inherits from the Cat class.
# You can add any specific attributes or methods for the Siamese breed, or leave it as is if there are no unique behaviors.

# Step 2: Create a List of Cat Instances
# Create a list called all_cats that contains instances of Bengal, Chartreux, and Siamese cats.
# Example: all_cats = [bengal_obj, chartreux_obj, siamese_obj]
# Give each cat a name and age.

# Step 3: Create a Pets Instance
# Create an instance of the Pets class called sara_pets, passing the all_cats list as an argument.

# Step 4: Take Cats for a Walk
# Call the walk() method on the sara_pets instance.
# This should print the result of calling the walk() method on each cat in the list.

# Example:

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())

# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# Step 1: Create the Siamese class

# Step 2: Create a list of cat instances

# Step 3: Create a Pets instance of the list of cat instances

# sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)

# Step 4: Take cats for a walk
# sara_pets.walk()

class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around.'

class Siamese(Cat):
    pass

class Bengal(Cat):
    pass

class Chartreux(Cat):
    pass

all_cats = [Bengal("Raj", 10), Chartreux("Fifi", 3), Siamese("Hachi", 6)]

sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)

sara_pets.walk()


#  Exercise 2: Dogs
# Instructions:

# Step 1: Create the Dog Class
# Create a class called Dog with name, age, and weight attributes.
# Implement a bark() method that returns “<dog_name> is barking”.
# Implement a run_speed() method that returns weight / age * 10.
# Implement a fight(other_dog) method that returns a string indicating which dog won the fight, based on run_speed * weight.

# Step 2: Create Dog Instances
# Create three instances of the Dog class with different names, ages, and weights.

# Step 3: Test Dog Methods
# Call the bark(), run_speed(), and fight() methods on the dog instances to test their functionality.

# Example (Conceptual, No Direct Solution):

# class Dog:
#     def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
#         # ... code to initialize attributes ...

#     def bark(self):
#         # ... code to return bark message ...

#     def run_speed(self):
#         # ... code to return run speed ...

#     def fight(self, other_dog):
#         # ... code to determine and return winner ...

# # Step 2: Create dog instances
# #... your code here

# # Step 3: Test dog methods
# print(dog1.bark())
# print(dog2.run_speed())
# print(dog1.fight(dog2))

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking."
    
    def run_speed(self):
        return self.weight / self.age * 10
    
    def fight(other_dog, arg):
        if run_speed * self.weight(dog1) > run_speed * self.weight(dog2) and run_speed * self.weight(dog3):
            return f"{dog1} won the fight."
        elif run_speed * self.weight(dog2) > run_speed * self.weight(dog1) and run_speed * self.weight(dog3):
            return f"{dog2} won the fight."
        else:
            return f"{dog3} won the fight."
        
dog1 = Dog("Roscoe", 4, 15)
dog2 = Dog("Happy", 7, 28)
dog3 = Dog("Spot", 12, 42)

print(dog1.bark())
print(dog2.run_speed())
